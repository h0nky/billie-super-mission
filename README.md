# npm run test to execute a test suite

# Few words about my solution.
# First of all I decided not go with create-react-app because it's redundant for the use cases like mine.
# I decided not to use redux almost because of the same reason. In my opinion it's an overkill in this case. Solution with the Context API seems simpler and more reasonable. I was trying to make my app as lean as possible.
# I suppose that visual redundancy is the thing that I could sacrifice for speed and simplicity in this case. So I went with plain CSS to create a layout and decided not to use any of CSS frameworks.

# If I would have more time then I would expand a test coverege in the first place. Also I would come up with the solution for the success message which I skipped.
